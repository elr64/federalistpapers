# Federalist Papers Author Attribution and Text Generation

This repository is compiled of a raw text copy of the entire Federalist Papers, downloaded from Project Gutenberg, a text file containing the function words defined by Mosteller and Wallace (1964), and three Jupyter notebooks. The goal of the project is to replicate previous author attribution models used to predict the disputed papers and compare the results of less intensive methods (i.e. including only the papers as training data and not performing TF-IDF).
