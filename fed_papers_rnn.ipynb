    "The recurrent neural network function reads in a list of strings of text. It then processes these texts for use in training a recurrent neural network. The preprocessing includes tokenizing and indexing the words, creating sequences of words and feature/label matrices. The features and labels are then split into training and validation, so that the quality of the model can be analyzed. A recurrent neural network is created with an embedding layer that creates word embeddings based on the vocabulary of the text and two long short-term memory layers, with appropriate dropout to prevent overtraining. The model stops training once the validation loss stops decreasing. Accuracy and perplexity are then calculated for the model. The model is then used to generate 3 500 word strings of text. These strings are printed and then the list of them is returned by the model.\n",
